## PUBLIC

#
# This class represents a piece of ZoomHub content.
# A piece of ZoomHub content associates a source URL with a unique ID,
# along with info about the input data, conversion progress, and output.
#
# This info is what we store in our database, but it's also what we return to
# clients of our API. Importantly, these two use cases are different --
# we don't want to return all info to clients, and conversely, we return extra
# data to clients that's easily derivable and shouldn't be stored.
#
# To achieve both these use cases, this class stores the database data as a
# private object, and exposes property getters on top of it for API clients.
# Importantly, the database data is non-enumerable, so it doesn't get included
# in JSON.stringify.
